    *          capturing to the left front, capturing two the right front, and
    *          two special moves, moving twice front if it is the pawn's first
    *          move, and promoting to another piece if it reaches the end of
    *          the board. This method checks if those moves are available for the
    *          given pawn, and if so, adds them to the corresponding vectors.
