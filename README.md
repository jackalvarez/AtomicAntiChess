# Explosive Anti Chess

Chess variation where the winner is the first player who runs out of pieces to move. Also, pieces explode.

## Rules

This chess variation has many similarities with regular chess. Bishops move diagonally, rooks move in straight lines, knights move in L shapes, the main difference is in the objective of the game.

In regular chess, the winner is the one who can checkmate the opponents king, usually the one with more pieces is the one leading. In this variant, the winner is the one whose pieces have been all taken (hence 'anti' chess). The other important change is that if a piece captures another piece, all the 8 squares around the captures square explode, meaning that if a piece was in a cell immediately besides the capturing square, the piece explodes and is removed from the board.

Because the winner is the one that runs out of pieces, a player is not advised to take the opponent's piece, especially if that pieces is surrounded by other opponent's pieces, as all of them will explode, thus helping your opponent get nearer to winning.
